# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-

In this project I have tried to build a machine learning model which can predict a handwritten digit (0-9).
To build the model I have used some python libraries like tensorflow, keras, numpy, matplotlib.
For now, I have used MNIST dataset but later on I will create my own dataset and will use it.
In the next part I will create a funtion which will capture the image and will make a GUI to predict the the digit.
